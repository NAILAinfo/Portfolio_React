## Project structure 

### Technical Skills Organization

Skills are managed using a data-driven approach:
- Data (categories, logos, strengths, length of experience) is defined in the dedicated SkillsData tsx file.
- React components (Skills.tsx, SkillCategory.tsx, SkillCard.tsx) dynamically display this data.
- Skill logos are stored in src/assets/skills.

#### Structure  
```bash
=======

src/
 ┣ assets/
 ┃ ┗ skillsIMG/            ← images (ex: pythonICON.png )
 ┣ components/
 ┃ ┗ Skills/ 
 ┃    ┗ Skills.tsx         ← main component (shows all categories)
 ┃    ┣ SkillCategory.tsx  ← displays a category with its skills
 ┃    ┣ SkillCard.tsx      ← displays individual skill
 ┃    ┣ SkillsData.tsx     ← skills data
<<<<<<< HEAD
 ┃    ┗ StyleSkills.css    
```
🔹 This method provides a clear separation between data and components and makes it easier to add skills later.

### Projects Organization
#### Data  :
Projects are defined in a JSON file located in the `src\assets\projects.json` , Example content:
```bash
[
  {
    "id": , 
    "state": , 
    "Featured": ,
    "title": ,
    "category": ,
    "description":  ,
    "image": ,
    "link":  ,
    "github_link" : , 

  },
]
```
#### Loading into the application
The `projects.json` file is retrieved using fetch:
```bash
useEffect(() => {
  fetch("/projects.json")
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setProjects(data));
}, []);
```
#### Component architecture
```bash
src/
 └── components/
      └── Projects/
           ├── ProjectsSection.jsx   # Main component 
           ├── ProjectsFilter.jsx    #Filtering area
           ├── ProjectsGrid.jsx      # Grid displaying filtered projects
           └── ProjectCard.jsx       # displays individual project
```
#### Image Management 
Images associated with projects are placed in `src\assets\Projectsimg`
In `projects.json` , each project references its image using a relative path, for example: 
```bash
image": "/images/portfolio.png
```

#### Future development
This structure was designed to evolve towards an external data source Google Sheets API.
